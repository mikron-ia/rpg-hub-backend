# RPG hub
A system for role-playing game story/campaign/epic (names vary from system to system) management. This repository contains the backend.

## Background
[Role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) are a very wide category, ranging from very simplistic systems to extremely complex mechanical solutions. What they do have in common, though, is the story - you can play a game without mechanics, but even a primitive dungeon crawl is going to have some story. Managing this story, its cast, threads, and - if present - mechanical components - is the role of this project.

The project is currently split in two parts - backend and [frontend](https://github.com/mikron-ia/rpg-hub-frontend). It is possible that the split will increase once some functionality requires it.

Backend is being written in PHP. Storage system has not yet been chosen, but it is likely to be MySQL, possibly with a document base as auxiliary.

## Development
Following is of course subject to change - I have a very hazy vision of the project at the moment.

### Required for v0.1
* Minimal viable domain model
* Test coverage for domain

### Required for v0.2
* Basic data loading
* Framework-based structure
* Skeleton API

### Required for v0.3
* API for data extraction
* Storage system

## Installation guide
... will be created once the project does anything except passing tests.
